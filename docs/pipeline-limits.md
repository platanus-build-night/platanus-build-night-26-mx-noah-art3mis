# Pipeline limits, caps & tuning knobs

A catalogue of every value that silently bounds what VERITRACE retrieves, reads, and counts toward a verdict. Some are user-configurable (surfaced in the settings panel); most are hardcoded constants. This doc exists because several of these decisions are invisible from the UI yet materially change the result — e.g. a source can be retrieved, classified, and then dropped before it ever influences a verdict. When something surprises you ("why didn't it use that source?"), start here.

Values current as of this writing — grep the cited symbol if in doubt.

## Configurable (surfaced in the settings panel)

These are threaded UI → `runConfig()` → `parseConfig` (`lib/run-config.ts`) → the pipeline. Defaults live in `DEFAULT_CONFIG`; ranges are enforced server-side.

| Setting            | Symbol / param                         | Range        | Default | Effect |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------|---------|--------|
| Model              | `model`                                | enum         | Haiku 4.5 | Which Claude model runs every reasoning call. |
| Temperature        | `temperature`                          | 0–1          | 0       | Sampling determinism. Inert when thinking is on or the model deprecates it. |
| Extended thinking  | `thinking`                             | on/off       | off     | Adds a `THINKING_BUDGET` (2048-token) reasoning budget. |
| Claims to extract  | `maxClaims`                            | 1–10         | 5       | How many atomic claims are kept from the source text. |
| Questions per claim| `maxQuestions`                         | 1–10         | 2       | Resolving questions each claim fans out into. |
| Sources per search | `maxSources` → Exa `numResults`        | 1–10         | 2       | Results returned per Exa search call. |
| Read depth         | `maxChars` → Exa `text.maxCharacters`  | 200–10000    | 6000    | How much of each source's body the **classifier** reads. See note below. |
| Deep search        | `deepSearch` → Exa `type`              | on/off       | off     | `"deep"` (agentic) vs `"auto"`. Higher recall, slower, pricier. |
| Source category    | `category` → Exa `category`            | ""/news/research paper/pdf | "" | Restrict retrieval to a content type for cleaner extraction; narrows recall. |
| Prefer fresh       | `preferFresh` → Exa `contents.livecrawl` | on/off     | off     | `"preferred"` live-crawls over cache. Fresher for breaking news, slower. |

### Read depth note — the highlight/text split

`maxChars` only became load-bearing once `RawEvidence` was split into two fields (`lib/exa.ts`):

- `passage` — a short, **question-focused** Exa highlight (`HIGHLIGHT_CHARS = 512`). This is what each evidence card shows.
- `text` — the fuller page body up to `maxChars`. This is what `classify.ts` actually feeds the model.

Before the split, `passage = highlight || text` meant the classifier read only the short highlight and the fetched body was discarded — so the Read-depth slider did almost nothing. If you revert to a single field, that silent inertness comes back.

## Hardcoded retrieval & gather limits (not surfaced)

| Symbol                     | File          | Value   | What it silently does |
|----------------------------|---------------|---------|-----------------------|
| `EVIDENCE_PER_QUESTION_CAP`| `resolve.ts`  | 6       | **Load-bearing.** Only the top 6 ranked sources per question survive into the verdict and the graph. Sources beyond 6 are still retrieved and classified (you pay for them), then dropped. The verdict literally cannot see source #7+. Ranking pins the best deciding `supports` and `refutes` first so a lone refutation isn't crowded out. |
| `MAX_SEARCHES`             | `resolve.ts`  | 4       | The gather agent gets at most 4 search round-trips per question, even if the evidence bar isn't met. |
| `MIN_DECIDING`             | `resolve.ts`  | 2       | Target: keep searching until ≥2 reliable deciding sources (incl. ≥1 primary). A goal the model is told to hit, backstopped by `MAX_SEARCHES`. |
| `WINDOW_BEFORE_DAYS`       | `resolve.ts`  | 30      | **Load-bearing.** Sources published >30 days before the claim's event date are filtered out by Exa. A relevant older source is invisible. |
| `WINDOW_AFTER_DAYS`        | `resolve.ts`  | 14      | **Load-bearing.** Sources published >14 days after the event date are filtered out. Only applies when the claim has a parsed date. |
| `HIGHLIGHT_CHARS`          | `exa.ts`      | 512     | Length of the card excerpt (display only — does not affect classification). |
| `SEGMENT_CEILING`          | `segment.ts`  | 16      | Max segments the source text is split into. |
| `FACT_CHECKERS` exclusion  | `exa.ts`      | **OFF** | The de-novo "don't read other fact-checks" exclusion is currently disabled (commented out) so the pipeline can reach primary sources via a fact-check's citations. Re-add `excludeDomains: FACT_CHECKERS` to restore the strict bar. |

## Verdict gating thresholds (load-bearing)

These decide whether a piece of evidence can move a verdict at all (`lib/pipeline/verdict.ts`, `isDeciding`). Uncertainty is modelled as **source reliability**, not a bare confidence number.

| Symbol                  | Value          | What it does |
|-------------------------|----------------|--------------|
| `MIN_STANCE_CONFIDENCE` | 0.5            | Evidence whose classifier stance-confidence is below 0.5 cannot decide — it can only contextualize. |
| `DECIDING_RELIABILITY`  | {high, medium} | Only high/medium reliability sources establish or flip a verdict. A **low**-reliability source (blog, social aggregator, anonymous) can only contextualize, never decide. |
| `PRIVILEGED_HIGH_DOMAINS` | [wikipedia.org] | `classify.ts` forces these domains to "high" reliability regardless of the model's call. |

Consequence: a claim with only low-reliability or low-confidence evidence resolves to **Not-Enough-Evidence**, even if every source agrees. This is intentional (the de-novo honesty bar) but invisible from the graph unless you read the reliability meters.

## Per-stage model token caps

Output-token ceilings on each Anthropic call. Mostly sized to fit the expected output; the classify cap is the one most at risk of truncation when many sources are gathered.

| Stage      | File           | `maxTokens` |
|------------|----------------|-------------|
| expand     | `expand.ts`    | 200         |
| questions  | `questions.ts` | 600         |
| segment    | `segment.ts`   | 1500        |
| gather     | `resolve.ts`   | 600         |
| classify   | `classify.ts`  | 2048        |
| summarize  | `summarize.ts` | 700         |
| thinking   | `run-config.ts`| 2048 (`THINKING_BUDGET`) |

## Known-issue cross-references

- Garbled passage text from Exa extraction (binary/PDF/SPA): issues #2 and #3. Relevant here because higher Read depth feeds proportionally more of any garbled body to the classifier — the issue-#3 sanitization gate becomes more important as `maxChars` rises.

## Candidates to surface as settings

If "why didn't it use that source?" keeps surprising users, the highest-value knobs to promote from hardcoded to configurable are `EVIDENCE_PER_QUESTION_CAP` (verdict can't see past the top 6) and the date window (`WINDOW_BEFORE_DAYS` / `WINDOW_AFTER_DAYS`). Both directly determine which evidence is allowed to count.
