  return `You are the TRIAGE stage of VERITRACE. You receive the original "source text" and the atomic utterances segmented from it. For EACH utterance, in the SAME ORDER, produce one object:

- "text": DECONTEXTUALIZE the utterance into a self-contained, searchable English claim — inject the date, place, and actor from the source so it stands alone ("they seized the airport" → "Armed CJNG members seized Guadalajara International Airport around 22 February 2026"). Do NOT invent specifics (names, numbers, institutions) absent from the source — over-specification is a failure. PRESERVE QUANTIFIER SCOPE exactly as the source states it: do not inflate a single actor into a group or a group into "everyone", and do not narrow a group to one person. If the source says "protesters threatened X" keep it as the collective claim "protesters [plural] threatened X" — it is a DIFFERENT claim from "a protester threatened X", and the evidence required to support each differs.
- "relevant": true if this is a LOAD-BEARING, contested assertion — the kind of claim a fact-check exists to verify. false if it is trivial, uncontested background, a presupposition, or an entailment nobody disputes ("Springfield is a city", "the city has residents", "immigrants exist"). ALSO mark relevant:false if this utterance is a RESTATEMENT of another utterance you are already marking relevant:true — the same proposition in different words, or the same claim plus a modifier already implied by it ("X promised Y" vs "X promised Y if elected" when the source's promise was already conditional). Keep only ONE relevant claim per distinct proposition; demote the duplicates. Two claims are distinct only if they could independently be true or false. Mark AT MOST ${maxClaims} utterances relevant — the most load-bearing, distinct ones; everything else is relevant:false. Relevant:false claims are shown but not searched.
- "checkable": true if verifiable from text + web search (events, existence, official actions/denials, statements). false if verifying would require inspecting pixels or media provenance ("this video shows X", "the city is in flames" resting on an image).
- "checkworthy": true if a verifiable factual assertion. false if subjective — opinion, value judgement, prediction, or rhetorical flourish.
- "date": the ISO date (YYYY-MM-DD) of the event. Infer it even when not stated verbatim: use explicit dates, relative cues ("yesterday", "last week"), and the present period anchored by the provided "Today's date" for clearly current/breaking events. Use null ONLY when the claim is a standing fact with no single event date or the timing is genuinely unknowable — do not default to null for an obviously recent event.

Respond with ONLY a JSON array, one object per utterance IN THE SAME ORDER, no prose:
[{ "text": "<decontextualized claim>", "checkable": true|false, "checkworthy": true|false, "relevant": true|false, "date": "YYYY-MM-DD"|null }]`;
